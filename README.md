This repository is dedicated to the scraping and data cleansing of engineering department information from the **YÖK Atlas** website, specifically the Electrics-Electronics Engineering major. The objective is to gather, clean, and structure data for further analysis and modeling.

## Source

[YÖK Atlas](https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr/) provides extensive data about Turkish university departments. Our primary focus is on the Electrics-Electronics Engineering major, and the data can be directly accessed [here](https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr/lisans-bolum.php?b=10056).

## Data Extraction

Given that the YÖK Atlas website loads some data dynamically based on interactions (like dropdown menus), it's crucial to monitor its network traffic to find the actual source of our target data.

Using developer tools, we've determined that the true data source is a dynamically generated PHP page: `https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr/content/lisans-dynamic/2010.php?y=105710042`. The `GET` parameter `y` denotes the university ID, which allows for easy scraping across different universities by altering this parameter.

## Data Scrubbing

The scraped data required thorough cleaning, primarily due to inconsistencies and corrupted entries in the HTML. Scripts were developed to handle:

- Missing values
- Data type conversions (e.g., text to numbers)

## Structure

The repository consists of:

- `departments.py`: Contains a dictionary mapping engineering department codes to their respective IDs.
- `main.py`: Employs BeautifulSoup4 to fetch and parse department names, attributes, and links, outputting a Pandas dataframe.
- `getData.py`: Uses the dataframe generated by `main.py` to further scrape details like student demographics, instructors, exam scores, and more.

## Data Fields

The final dataset incorporates:

### University Information

- University Name
- Department Language
- Duration of Program
- Department's Secondary Education Status
- Scholarship Type
- Distance Learning Availability
- University Web Link
- YÖK University ID

### Student Data

- Current Male Students
- Current Female Students
- Total Current Students
- Graduated Male Students
- Graduated Female Students
- Total Graduates
- New Student Count
- Last Enrolled Student's Exam Score

### Instructors

- Professors
- Associate Professors
- PhD Holders
- Total Instructors

## Output

The cleaned dataset is saved as both a `.csv` and `.pkl` (Pickle) file, ready for analysis and modeling tasks.

## Conclusion

Through meticulous web scraping and data cleansing, this project provides a structured dataset of the Electrics-Electronics Engineering departments across Turkish universities. This invaluable data is now primed for any research, analysis, or modeling endeavors.
